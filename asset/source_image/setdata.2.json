Both characters involved in a challenge receive damage at the same time and are also banished due to taking damage equal to or greater than their willpower at the same time if applicable. This means that at the time King Louie's ability is able to trigger he would already be banished and therefore no longer in play.

Ability, what characters can I choose for each part of her effect?\nA: When using the Who is the Fairest? Ability of The Queen - Commanding Presence you must choose an opponent's character to receive -4 strength. This means that you can only choose either Mickey Mouse or Maleficent to receive -4 strength in this example. When using the second part of the Who is the Fairest? Ability you may choose any character to receive +4 strength. In this example you may choose Mickey Mouse, Maleficent, The Queen or Flounder to receive +4 strength. Note that you must choose a character for each part of the ability so you are not able to decrease the strength of a character and not increase the strength of a character."
