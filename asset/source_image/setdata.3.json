Even if Let the Storm Rage on banishes your Ursula - Deceiver of All, you can still use her What a Deal ability. In this case you won't be able to deal 2 damage to a character, as there aren't any in play, but you still draw a card.",

If I use her What a Deal ability to play The Boss is On a Roll again and choose to put 1 more card on the bottom of my deck, where does my copy of The Boss is On a Roll go in relation to the other cards I placed on the bottom of my deck?\nA: The Boss is On a Roll will be the bottom-most card of your deck, regardless of how many cards you put on the bottom of your deck each time you played it. The card played a second time with Ursula - Deceiver of All's ability What a Deal is placed on the bottom of your deck after its effect has finished."

When a character in play is put into a player's inkwell, the character first leaves play and then is put into the inkwell. This means Gramma Tala isn't in play to see a card being put into your inkwell, so you can't use her ability. Note that this is still the case if Gramma Tala was shifted and there's a card underneath her."
